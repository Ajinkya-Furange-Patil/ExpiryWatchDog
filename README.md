## 🚀 Future Roadmap

### 🔮 AI-Powered Expiry Replacement Suggestions

We're planning to integrate a smart recommendation engine that:

- Detects when a product is near expiry (within 7 days)
- Suggests a replacement product based on your usage pattern
- Uses affiliate links from Amazon, Flipkart, or other platforms
- Offers convenience for users and generates passive income to sustain the project

> 💡 Example: If your milk expires in 3 days, we’ll recommend a top-rated brand you can re-order — just one click away!

This system will benefit both:

- **Users**: Easy re-purchase with trustable recommendations
- **Us**: Earn affiliate commissions to support development
